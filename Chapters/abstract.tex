\chapter*{Abstract}
The development of modular robotic platforms has a set of problems with multiple possible solutions, spanning through multiple disciplines, defining a good concept that allows enough flexibility to abstract most of the developmental aspect should open the doors to many people to get started in this field and tackle more advanced concepts in robotics at ease, by acting as a platform/ an ecosystem such as Adruino for embedded systems or operating systems for computers. In order to realize such platforms and assure their flexibility, adaptability and uniqueness; In this thesis I will present my philosophies regarding the development of modular, upgradable and interchangeable components to form my families of robotic platforms known as "ASCE platforms", as well as using them together to test different related concepts in robotics and control and development.
%more onto this later

%let's mention in this thesis the context of modularity, if modularity was a universe, our platforms are intended to reach different spaces AND different times unlike competition.

%let's also mention what we mean by space and time, space = dicipline or domain/field 
%time = level, target audience, learning ? developing ? children ? all levels of abstraction are tappable!

%add seciton about software support, talk about RTOS and code safety and such.
%talk about building on existing toolchains in literature such as Arduino UNO
%talk how we can expand by providing modules, upgrade kits and software support (Refer to sparkfun, digikey and such players).
%task it to maximize integration rates and domestic production.

\section{Introduction}
In robotic systems, batteries are not merely an energy source---they are a critical component that directly influences performance, autonomy, and reliability. Robotics applications, from mobile platforms to embedded sensor nodes, require power systems that are both energy-dense and robust against degradation. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of battery power fundamentals, key battery parameters (such as capacity, C-rate, and internal resistance), energy conversion and loss mechanisms, charging methodologies, and advanced battery management techniques. Special emphasis is placed on how these concepts underpin robotic applications. Recent research highlights, including works by Roscher \emph{et al.} \cite{Roscher2011}, Rauf \emph{et al.} \cite{Rauf2022}, and Rahman and Alharbi \cite{Rahman2024}, are discussed throughout to present state-of-the-art insights.

\section{Fundamentals of Battery Power}
Batteries convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy, powering robotic operations through controlled electrochemical reactions. The instantaneous power output \(P\) of a battery is given by:
\begin{equation}
P = V \times I,
\end{equation}
where \(V\) is the terminal voltage and \(I\) is the current. Over time, the total work \(W\) provided by the battery is:
\begin{equation}
W = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} V(t) \cdot I(t) \, dt.
\end{equation}
These relationships are fundamental when designing power budgets for robotic missions, where continuous operation under variable load conditions is required.

\section{Key Battery Characteristics and Terminology}
A thorough understanding of battery performance involves multiple key parameters:

\subsection{Capacity and Energy Storage}
Battery capacity, measured in ampere-hours (Ah), represents the total electric charge a battery can store. The energy content \(E\) (in watt-hours, Wh) is given by:
\begin{equation}
E = V \times Q,
\end{equation}
where \(Q\) denotes the capacity. In robotics, high capacity is crucial for extended missions, yet must be balanced against weight and size constraints.

\subsection{C-Rate and Operational Dynamics}
The C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current normalized by the battery's nominal capacity. For example, a 1C rate implies that the battery discharges its full capacity in one hour. If a 2 Ah battery is discharged at 2 A, the rate is 1C; at 4 A, it is 2C. Higher C-rates can lead to rapid energy delivery, which is desirable for high-power maneuvers in robotics. However, they also induce thermal stress and accelerate degradation \cite{Rahman2024}.

\subsection{Internal Resistance and Voltage Drop}
The battery's internal resistance \(R_{\text{int}}\) is a key factor that affects its performance. Under load, the voltage drop across \(R_{\text{int}}\) can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
V_{\text{drop}} = I \times R_{\text{int}}.
\end{equation}
Consequently, the power loss due to internal resistance is:
\begin{equation}
P_{\text{loss}} = I^2 \times R_{\text{int}}.
\end{equation}
These losses generate heat and reduce the effective energy delivered, making thermal management a priority in robotic power systems.

\section{Energy Conversion and Loss Mechanisms}
Understanding energy conversion in batteries is essential for efficient system design. While the chemical-to-electrical conversion is highly effective, several loss mechanisms reduce the net energy output:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resistive Losses:} As described by Equation (4), losses due to internal resistance diminish available power.
    \item \textbf{Thermal Losses:} Elevated operating temperatures increase resistive losses and can lead to accelerated degradation.
    \item \textbf{Electrochemical Inefficiencies:} Side reactions and incomplete charge transfer reduce the effective capacity.
\end{itemize}
In robotics, minimizing these losses directly translates to longer operational time and higher reliability.

\section{Battery Charging Techniques}
Efficient charging is critical for maintaining battery health and longevity in robotic systems.

\subsection{The CCCV Charging Protocol}
Most modern batteries, particularly lithium-ion types, are charged using the Constant Current-Constant Voltage (CCCV) method. Initially, a constant current is applied until the battery voltage reaches a set threshold. Thereafter, the charger maintains a constant voltage, and the current gradually decreases. This protocol minimizes overcharging and thermal stress, thereby reducing degradation over multiple cycles.

\subsection{Advanced Charging Strategies}
Beyond CCCV, advanced techniques such as pulse charging and adaptive charging algorithms are under investigation. These strategies aim to optimize charge acceptance and reduce aging by dynamically adjusting the charging profile based on battery temperature, state-of-charge (SOC), and internal resistance feedback \cite{Rauf2022}.

\subsection{Battery Management Systems (BMS)}
A sophisticated BMS is crucial for robotics, where the battery must be monitored and controlled in real time. Modern BMS architectures integrate sensor arrays to measure voltage, current, temperature, and impedance. By using data-driven methods and machine learning, the BMS can predict state-of-health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL), and adjust charging parameters to extend battery life \cite{Rahman2024}.

\section{Battery Degradation Mechanisms}
Battery degradation is an inevitable phenomenon that impacts the performance and safety of robotic systems. Key degradation factors include:

\subsection{Cycling Degradation}
\res{I may include some graphics and schematics on the mechanism of battery degradation here ?}

Frequent charge-discharge cycles lead to capacity fade. Repeated cycling results in the gradual breakdown of electrode materials and the formation of passivation layers, which increases internal resistance and reduces energy storage capacity \cite{Roscher2011}.

\subsection{Thermal Effects}
High operating temperatures accelerate degradation through enhanced chemical reactions. Excessive heat can lead to electrolyte breakdown and structural damage within the cell. Robotic systems operating in harsh environments must implement active or passive thermal management strategies to mitigate these effects.

\subsection{Depth of Discharge and Calendar Aging}
Deep discharges stress the battery and reduce its overall life span. Additionally, even without cycling, batteries undergo calendar aging due to slow chemical reactions over time. Both factors must be carefully managed in robotics to ensure consistent performance.

\subsection{Mathematical Modeling of Degradation}
Quantitative models for battery degradation are crucial for predicting SOH and RUL. A common expression for SOH is:
\begin{equation}
\text{SOH} = \frac{Q_{\text{actual}}}{Q_{\text{nominal}}} \times 100\%,
\end{equation}
where \(Q_{\text{actual}}\) is the current capacity and \(Q_{\text{nominal}}\) is the initial capacity. More sophisticated models incorporate changes in internal resistance and other parameters, enabling predictive maintenance and adaptive energy management in robotics \cite{Roscher2011}.

\section{State-of-Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation}
SOH and RUL are vital metrics for battery performance monitoring:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State-of-Health (SOH):} Represents the current capacity relative to the nominal capacity. It is a direct measure of degradation and informs about the battery's ability to deliver power.
    \item \textbf{Remaining Useful Life (RUL):} Estimates the number of cycles or the time remaining before the battery degrades to a level that necessitates replacement.
\end{itemize}
Advanced techniques for SOH and RUL estimation leverage both physics-based models and data-driven approaches, including Kalman filters and machine learning algorithms. These methodologies have been successfully applied to optimize battery performance in robotics, where real-time estimation is essential \cite{Rauf2022,Rahman2024}.

\section{Implications for Robotics}
In robotics, battery performance directly affects operational efficiency, endurance, and reliability. Key considerations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy Density vs. Weight:} High energy density is critical for extending mission duration, yet must be balanced against weight constraints in mobile robotic platforms.
    \item \textbf{Thermal Management:} Robust cooling strategies are essential to mitigate heat-induced degradation, especially in high-performance or outdoor robotics.
    \item \textbf{Modular Battery Architectures:} For robotics, designing batteries that are easily replaceable or upgradable enables flexibility and extended system lifetimes.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Power Management:} Incorporating real-time SOH and RUL estimations allows robotic systems to adapt their energy usage and charging cycles dynamically, thereby maximizing operational efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\section{Case Studies and Applications in Robotics}
Several robotic systems have successfully integrated advanced battery management to enhance performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mobile Robotics:} Autonomous rovers and drones require batteries that can handle high C-rates for rapid acceleration and deceleration. The integration of BMS with predictive algorithms ensures that these platforms can operate reliably in dynamic environments.
    \item \textbf{Embedded Systems:} In sensor networks and IoT devices, battery longevity is paramount. Techniques such as adaptive charging and low-power management extend the operational life of these systems.
    \item \textbf{Educational and Research Platforms:} Open-source robotics platforms benefit from modular battery architectures, allowing students and researchers to experiment with different power management strategies and observe the effects of degradation in real time.
\end{itemize}
These examples underscore the importance of battery optimization in achieving the desired performance and reliability in diverse robotic applications.

\section{Future Research Directions and Challenges}
Despite significant advancements, several challenges remain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Improving Degradation Models:} There is a need for more accurate and robust models that can account for the complex interplay of factors affecting battery degradation in real-world robotics applications.
    \item \textbf{Integration of AI in BMS:} Further integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence could enable more precise real-time monitoring and adaptive control, leading to better SOH and RUL predictions.
    \item \textbf{Sustainable Battery Technologies:} Research into new battery chemistries and materials that offer higher energy density and longer life spans will be crucial for the future of robotics.
    \item \textbf{Miniaturization and Modularity:} Developing modular battery packs that can be easily integrated into various robotic platforms without compromising performance remains an ongoing engineering challenge.
\end{itemize}
Addressing these challenges will be key to developing the next generation of robotic systems with enhanced autonomy and reliability.
